# eda using python

Welcome to my repository! This project is a collection of my early exercises and projects as I learn to code with Python and explore data libraries. 
I am using VS Code as my main editor and managing my code with GitHub Desktop.

I started by learning the basics of Python, such as how to use variables, loops, and functions.

 After that, I began practicing with NumPy to handle math and numerical arrays. 

 I also learned how to use Pandas to organize data into tables, which makes it much easier to filter and clean information. 

 To visualize my results, I used Matplotlib to create simple charts like line graphs and scatter plots.

In this repository, you will find different folders for each of these topics.

 My goal is to keep practicing every day until I can work with larger, real-world datasets.
 
To run these files, you just need to have Python installed along with the NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries.
